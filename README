SmartQ Magic SD Builder SDK

These files were the initramfs that the SmartQ devices used as an alternate
boot to run the installer.  It can be used for other purposes such as an
altboot capability, etc.... 

...so lets go' :) (Tanguy)

HOWTO:

  go to the initramfs Directory, check content of "./compress.sh" and then execute
  you only need a Kernel zImage and corresponding modules in content/lib/modules

  this script will pack an initrd.igz compatible with SmartQ format and pack it
  with kernel into an Image named SmartQ5
